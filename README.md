# Radar-Imaging-Experiences
This repository contains two radar imaging experiments, focusing on radar signal processing and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imaging.

* exp2: SAR Imaging Simulation
  * Generate radar images using a mobile platform that emits LFM/NLFM signals. Apply multiple imaging algorithms to SAR data.
 
* exp3: Satellite SAR Data Processing
  * Process actual satellite SAR data and present the results of various processing steps like distance pulse and azimuth compression.
 
Please run the codes with MATLAB. Enjoy working on radar technology and SAR imaging!
